Challenges:
1. successful application of deep neural networks typically rely on large amounts of data and direct supervision of the output, neigher of which is avaiable in robotic control.
2. learning algorithm must determine on its own which action to take at each point.
3. observations from the robot's sensors do not provide us with the full state of the system.

The challenges are addressed by developing a guided policy search algorithm for sensorimotor deep learning, as well as a novel CNN architecture designed for robotic control.

 Our CNNs have 92,000 parameters and 7 layers, including a novel spatial feature point transformation that provides accurate spatial reasoning and reduces overfitting.

Background and overview:
In this section, we define the visuomotor policy learning problem and present an overview of our approach. The core component of our approach is a guided policy search algorithm that separates the problem of learning visuomotor policies into separate supervised learning
and trajectory learning phases, each of which is easier than optimizing the policy directly. We also discuss a policy architecture suitable for end-to-end learning of vision and control, and a training setup that allows our method to be applied to real robotic platforms.
